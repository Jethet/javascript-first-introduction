        lastName: "Doe",

   /* The output: if the property isForSale equals to true, the expected output 
   to the console should be: 
   The owner, John Doe put the home for sale! The property has 4 amenities. 
   In the other case, we should see the following: 
   The home in Happy St no. 123 is not for sale.   
    Hint: To get the number of amenities, use length property of the array. */
