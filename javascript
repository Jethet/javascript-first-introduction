JavaScript STATEMENTS END WITH SEMI-COLUMN ;

JS data types: (can all be stored in variables)
string
number
symbol
object
boolean
null
undefined

variables cannot start with a number or contain spaces but $ and _ can be used
(example: var myName; var _a1b2;)

Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the
= operator is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the
left of the operator. Example: assign a to b:
var a;
var b;
a = 7;
b = 7;
b = a;

To run JS files use node (download www.node.org),
using the command: node file.js
