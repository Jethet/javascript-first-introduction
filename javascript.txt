Use = for assignment: let a = 3
Use == for comparison: let a == let b  (or != for unequal to)
Use === to test if a value is PRECISELY the same: let a === let b
(or a !== b for not the same)
---------------------------------------------------

JS data types: (can all be stored in variables)
string
number
symbol
object
boolean
null
undefined

variables cannot start with a number or contain spaces but $ and _ can be used
(example: let myName; let _a1b2;)

EMPTY VALUES: two special values are null and undefined. These denote the absence of meaningful value.
Null and undefined are values but carry no information.

TYPE OF VARIABLE: use typeof (lowercast!!)   ==> console.log(typeof myVar);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JS uses type coercion. This means that when an operator is applied to the "wrong" type of value, JS converts
a value to the type it needs, with a confusing set of rules. Example:
console.log("5" - 1);  will result in 4
console.log("5" + 1);  will result in 51
This can be useful to find out if a value has a real value, example: console.log(null==0);
This means that with == JS can CHANGE the type of value.
If you want to test if a value is PRECISELY equal to the other (or not) use: === and !==
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the
= operator is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the
left of the operator. Example:
declaring variables: let a;  let b;
initialising variables: a = 7;  b = 7;
assigning a to b: b = a;

It is custom to declare and initialise in the same line: let a = 7;
You can declare more variables: let x, y, z; (commas!) assign separately: x = 3; y = 5; z = 7; (semi-columns!)
Before, var was used but this has no scope constraints while let has scope constraints:
let is constrained to whichever scope it is declared in.
A variable that is declared but not initialised has the value 'undefined'
For a number the result with an undefined variable will be 'NaN' (not a number).
For a string, the result will be "undefined".
Also, let cannot be used to re-declare a variable and will return: 'Identifier has
already been declared'.

const: a variable which value will be constant. When a const is declared, the value that
is assigned to const will never change (returns "xxx" is read-only if you try to change).
Declaring a const communicates and guarantees this variable will never be changed.
Syntax: declare full variable info ==> const name = "Ada"; (NOT with 'let').
WHERE POSSIBLE, CONST is PREFERRED over LET or VAR.

VARIABLE NAMES should be camelCase: first word lowercase, subsequent words are capitalised

GLOBAL SCOPE: variables which are defined with var outside of a function block have Global
scope, i.e. they can be seen everywhere in the JavaScript code. It is important to use var when declaring a variable.
LOCAL SCOPE: variables declared in a function are not defined outside that function, i.e.
not visible.
It is possible to have both local and global variables with the SAME name. In this case the
local variable takes precedence over the global variable.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
addition (+), subtraction (-), division (/) and multiplication (*) are the same as in Python.
incrementing (adding) one to a variable is done with ++
Example: i = i + 1 can be used with the ++ operator and becomes: i++

Important operators are +=  and  -=  (compound assignments)
examples:
let myVar = 1;
myVar += 5;
console.log(myVar); (returns 6)

myVar = myVar - 5;
myVar -= 5; (returns 0)

This can also be done with multiplication: *  and  division /
examples:
myVar = myVar * 5; can be written: myVar *= 5;
myVar = myVar / 2; can be written: myVar /= 2;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONVERT number to string and vice versa:
To change a string into a number: Number(n) or put + before varName.toFixed(n).
Use toString() to convert a number to a string.

BIG NUMBERS: use 'e'
const someVar = 2e4;  ==> 20000   (same as 2 * 10000)
const myVar = 5e-4;   ==> 0.0005  (same as 5/10000)

JavaScript has a Math module which contains more advanced functions:
    Math.abs      calculates the absolute value of a number
    Math.exp      calculates e to the power of a number
    Math.random() will give a random number x where 0<=x<1 (not including 1 !)
    Math.pow(x,y) calculates the result of x to the power of y
    Math.floor()  rounds down: removes the fraction part from a number
    Math.ceil()   rounds up: adds to fraction part to become next full number
    Math.round()  rounds to the nearest integer
    Math.max(x,y) returns greatest of number of arguments
    Math.min(x,y) returns smallest of number of arguments
   
ROUNDING TO DIGITS:
To round a number to two or whatever digits, use multiply and divide with Math.round():
let myNumber = 5.34567;
let roundedToOne = Math.round(myNumber*10)/10;    ==> 5.3
let roundedToTwo = Math.round(myNumber*100)/100;  ==> 5.34    (Note decimal rounding to 34!)
let roundedToThree = Math.round(myNumber*1000)/1000; ==> 5.346  (Note decimal rounding to 46!)

BINARY NUMERAL SYSTEM causes 'off' calculations !!
0.1 + 0.2 will result in 0.3000000000000004  Same problem with multiplication, or typing any 
number in 16 digits  => this creates HUGE problems with calculations.
To avoid this: always use .toFixed(n) and make sure you change the result into a number
with Number() because .toFixed(n) always returns a string !!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quotes: using "" for a string means that quotes cause problems. JS uses \ in front of a quoted text:
"This is how to \"quote\" a quote."
IMPORTANT: when using single quotes ('') and double quotes (""), for example describing a conversation,
there should be an even set of quotes. Watch out with things like 'I'm': this MUST be: 'I\'m' ==> backslash

There are two reasons to use escaping characters:
  1) To allow you to use characters you may not otherwise be able to type out, such as a carriage returns.
  2) To allow you to represent multiple quotes in a string without JavaScript misinterpreting what you mean.

Code	Output
\'	 single quote
\"	 double quote
\\	 backslash
\n	 newline
\r	 carriage return
\t	 tab
\b	 word boundary
\f	 form feed
Note that the backslash itself must be escaped in order to display as a backslash !!

Concatenation: build a new string out of other strings by concatenating (+) them together.
NOTE: spaces must be added where needed, within ""
NOTE: use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string to break a long string
over several lines. This means:
myVar = "This is a very long long long long sentence, including a space because another
sentence is added. " myVar += "This part is added after the first part."
THESE TWO STRINGS WILL BE JOINED INTO ONE STRING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRING METHODS to manipulate strings:
.length:      with myVar.length you can calculate the length of a string.
index[]:      to find a specific instance in a string: myVar[1] for the second
              character. Get last char with myVar[myVar.length - 1];
              NOTE: first mention variable and then [] brackets with let .length -1 !!
.toUpperCase: returns uppercased version of string on which this method is applied.
.charAt(X):   shows the character on the Xth position in the string, counting from 0.
.indexOf(substr):  returns index of character or string occurrence in a main string.
.includes():  case-sensitive search to find particular pattern in a string (true or false).
.substring(start, end):    extracts characters from a string between two points, NOT
                           including 'end' point, and returns new string.
.slice(start, end):        extracts characters from a string between two points, NOT
                           including 'end', and returns new string without altering original.


ARRAYS: square brackets; indexing possible (also nested indexing)
PUSH: add new value at END:  myArray.push()
POP: remove and return the LAST value of array:  myArray.pop()
SHIFT: remove and return the FIRST value of array: myArray.shift()
UNSHIFT: add a new value as the FIRST value of array: myArray.unshift()

SPLICING: Splicing arrays in JavaScript removes a certain part from an array and/or
adds a new element in the array. The index (starting at 0) indicates WHERE the
removal/addition will be. Syntax is: myArray.splice(1, 2) ==> on index 1 position
two elements will be removed: element on position 1 and 2.
Using splice to add: myArray.splice(2, 0, "addition") ==> on index 2 position,
no element is removed and a new element is added after it (so on index 3).
Using splice to replace: myArray.splice(2, 1, "replace") ==> on index 2 position,
the element is deleted and "replace" is put in position index 2.
The deleted element(s) can be put into a variable:
let myArray = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]; ==> let mySplice = myArray.splice(3,5);
will give:  mySplice = (3,4,5,6,7,8,9)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONDITIONALS:
&& (= and) can be used to combine conditions: if (val a < 10 && val a > 20) ....
|| (= or) can be used to check conditions to see if ONE of them is true or false: if (val a < 10 || val b > 20)
WITH < YOU ALSO INCLUDE THE NUMBER THAT IS STATED: x < 5 can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 AND 5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SWITCH STATEMENT can be used to handle many options to choose from. A switch statement tests a value and can
have many case statements which define various possible values. Statements are executed from the first matched
case value until a break is encountered:
switch(num) {
  case value1:
    statement1;
    break;
  case value2:
    statement2;
    break;
...
  case valueN:
    statementN;
    break;
}

Case values are tested with strict equality (===). The break tells JavaScript to stop executing statements.
If the break is omitted, the next statement will be executed.
It is possible to add a default statement for values that do not meet the case values:
switch (val) {
case value1:
  statement1;
  break;
default:
  default statement;
  break;
}
If the break statement is omitted from a switch statement's case, the following case statement(s) are executed
until a break is encountered. For MULTIPLE INPUTS with the SAME OUTPUT, a switch statement like this can be used:
switch(val) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
  case 3:
    result = "1, 2, or 3";
    break;
  case 4:
    result = "4 alone";
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IF and ELSE IF and ELSE loops:
function test (myCondition) {
  if (myCondition) {
     return "It was true";
  } else if (otherCondition) {
    return "It could be true";
  } else {
  return "It was false";
  }
}
The function is executed from TOP to BOTTOM so be careful of what statement comes first.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOR loop:
For loops are declared with three optional expressions separated by semicolons:
for (initialization; condition; final-expression) {  ....  }
The initialization statement is executed only once before the loop starts, to define
and setup the loop variable.
The condition statement is evaluated at the beginning of every loop iteration, and
will continue for as long as it evaluates to true. When condition is false at the start
of the iteration, the loop will stop executing.
This means if condition starts as false, the loop will never execute.
The final-expression is executed at the end of each loop iteration, prior to the next
condition check and is usually used to increment or decrement the counter. This can be
done i++ or i+=2 or i+=3, etc.  Example: for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { .... }
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHILE loop:
let ourArray = [];
let i = 0;
while(i < 5) {
  ourArray.push(i);   ==> this adds i to ourArray[]
  i++;                ==> this iterates until i === 5
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DO .. WHILE loop:
A do...while loop will first do one pass of the code inside the loop no matter what,
and then continue to run the loop while the specified condition evaluates to true:
let ourArray = [];
let i = 0;
do {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while i < 5;
Important: a do .. while loop ensures that the code inside the loop runs at least ONCE.
The condition comes after running the code and if this condition is met, the loop will
stop. If the condition is not met, the loop will continue.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOREACH  (forEach) loops:
forEach iterates through the array and has access to each element, and is more readable.
In ES5 (option 1):
myArray.forEach(function(whatever){
  console.log(`This is ${whatever}`)
});
===> the closing bracket comes last!! the curly braces are INSIDE of the brackets
     of the function

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BREAK and CONTINUE:
break:  exits the loop, continues executing code after the loop (if there is any),
        'jumps out' of the loop.
continue: breaks one iteration in the loop if a specified condition appears, then
          continues with the next iteration in the loop: 'jumps over' one iteration.
          ==> continue in 'while' loop: condition is tested,, and if true the loop
              is executed again;
          ==> continue in 'for' loop: increment expression (i++) is first evaluated,
              then the condition is tested to see if another iteration should be done.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OBJECTS:
Objects are collections of values called properties, in a data structure similar to
a dictionary. Objects are initialised with {}: let myObject = {}.
The properties of objects are written as key-value pairs i.e. name and value separated
by a column (name: value) and with , between the property lines.
Properties can be numbers or strings. If an object has any non-string properties,
JavaScript will automatically typecast them as strings.

ACCESS DATA IN OBJECTS:
The data in objects can be accessed through the properties, either with dot notation
or indexing. Dot notation can be used if the name of the property to be accessed
is known:
let myObj = {
  prop1: "val1",
  prop2: "val2"
};
let prop1val = myObj.prop1;   (to access "val1")
let prop2val = myObj.prop2;   (to access "val2")

The second way to access the properties of an object is indexing (brackets [""]).
If the property of the object has a space in its name, bracket notation must be
used to access it. It is also possible to use bracket notation on object properties
with spaces. Note: the property with spaces must be between QUOTES:
let testObj = {
  "an entree": "hamburger",
  "my side": "veggies",
  "the drink": "water"
};
let entreeValue = testObj["an entree"];     (to access "hamburger")
let drinkValue = testObj["the drink"];      (to access "water")

NOTE: Another use of bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is
stored as the value of a variable. This can be very useful for iterating through
an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.
It is possible to assign a variable to a property: let X = firstName, a property
from let objExample), then access this property: let Y = objExample[X];.
A variable can be assigned to another variable and this can be used to lookup data:
let a = {1:"one", 2:"two", 3:"three"}
let result = let number[val]
result = number[2]  ==> returns "two"

UPDATE - ADD - DELETE  PROPERTIES:
After creating a JavaScript object, its properties can be updated by using either
dot or bracket notation:
myObject.lastName = "New name"   or   myObject["lastName"] = "New name"
ADDING properties works the same way: myObject.newProperty = "A new property"
DELETE PROPERTIES with 'delete' and space:  delete myObject.newProperty

OBJECT METHODS:
Object.keys(name-of-object);  this returns a list of all keys (= all properties)

LOOPING OVER OBJECTS
get all keys with: for(let key in name-of-object){    (NOTE: let key !!)
                              console.log(key);
                              }
get all values with: for(let key in name-of-object){
                              console.log(name-of-object[key]);       (NOTE: use brackets !!)
                              }
get key and values with: for(let key in name-of-object){
                              console.log(`Key ${key} with value ${name-of-object[key]}`)
                              }
IN operator:
The in operator is used to verify if a certain property exists in an object;
it returns true or false:  console.log("prop" in name-of-object);

DETERMINE PROPERTY:
Use the .hasOwnProperty(propname) method of objects to determine if that object
has the given property name.
.hasOwnProperty() returns true or false if the property is found or not.

COMPLEX OBJECTS:
A variable can have a complex structure, for example an array which contains objects
and these objects have various properties in key/value format. These properties can
be strings, numbers or arrays. This means that:
let a = [
  {
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Baker"
  },
  {
  "firstName": "Paul"
  "Age": 25
  }
  {"type of function": ["clerk", "manager", "bookkeeper"]
  }
]
ACCESS DATA IN COMPLEX OBJECTS:
Use both the .dot and []brackets methods:
"employee" = a.0["firstName"]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NESTED DATA STRUCTURES: arrays & objects
This is about organising data: const myObject = {     const secObject = {
                                  prop1: "One",          prop1: "Word",
                                  prop2: "Two"           prop2: "sentence"
This can be an array: []            }                      }
const theseObj = [
  {
    {prop1: "One",
    prop2: "Two"},
    },
    {prop1: "Word",
    prop2: "Sentence"
    }
  ]
ACCESS DATA from an array of objects:
theseObj[0]  ==> returns: prop1: "One", prop2: "Two"
theseObj[0].prop1 ==> returns: "One"


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS are built using:
function functionName() {
  <what the function does>;
  <optional: return; ==> this ends the function immediately!>
}

- A function name should start with verb (e.g. function findValue, sayHello, calculateEven).
- A function should do ONE THING: separate a big problem into smaller ones.
- Grouping bunches of instructions may mean the function is doing more than one thing.
- Functions of more than 20 lines of code are probably not right.

PARAMETERS can be used: variables that act as placeholders until values (arguments) are passed
into the function. Pass values into a function with ARGUMENTS and use a return statement to 
send a value back out of a function.

If, else if, for and switch can all be used inside a function.

A variable can receive the value of a function: everything on the right of the = sign is 
resolved before assigning the result to a variable:
let myVar;
function myFunc(num) {
  return (num + 25) / 10;
}
myVar = myFunc(15);  ==> this would be 4
NOTE: semi-columns used everywhere.

FUNCTION DECLARATION: created at the beginning of the script when execution starts
==> using function declaration we can call a function before it is initialised:
greeting("Ana");
function greeting(name){
  console.log(`Hello ${name}!`)
}
FUNCTION EXPRESSION: created when execution reaches to that point in the code (and can
be used from that point onwards, NOT earlier).

ARROW FUNCTIONS have a simpler syntax (similar to function expression):
let greeting = name => {
  return name;
}
This can be SHORTENED to: let greeting = name => name;
PARENTHESES are obligatory if no parameter or more than one parameter is passed:
let greeting = (firstName, lastName) => name;

CALLBACK functions are functions that are passed into another function (only function name is
used when passing into other function, no () are used): a callback function is executed AFTER
another function is executed. This way you can make sure some piece of code does not execute 
BEFORE some other code has finished executing.

ANONYMOUS functions are declared without a name to refer to the function. It is not accessible
after creation, unless it is assigned to a variable: const anon = function() { .... } etc. An
anonymous function can be used as a parameter passed to another function.

RECURSION
Recursion is a function calling itself. 
A recursive function has 3 key features:
1. a termination condition (to prevent the recursion from running forever)
2. a base case: the goal of the recursive function (if (....) return ...)
3. the recursion: the function calling itself.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROMPT for input (only works in browser environment)
When the function prompt() is called it is passed a string and it will present the user with the string and
a textbox to enter a value in. The prompt function returns whatever value the user has inputted.
Example:    let name = prompt('What is your name?');

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Factorial of a number:
Multiply the number by itself and then again minus one until you reach the number one:
Factorial of 4 is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 (= 24)
