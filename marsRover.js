/* Result is:
Rover facing direction E, x is 1 and y is 0
Rover facing direction E, x is 2 and y is 0
Rover facing direction E, x is 3 and y is 0
Rover facing direction E, x is 4 and y is 0
Rover facing direction E, x is 5 and y is 0
Rover facing direction E, x is 6 and y is 0
Rover facing direction E, x is 7 and y is 0
Rover facing direction E, x is 8 and y is 0
Rover facing direction E, x is 9 and y is 0
Rover facing direction E, x is 10 and y is 0
Rover facing direction E, x is 10 and y is 0
Rover facing direction E, x is 10 and y is 0
This means that a) changing direction works fine; b) rover stops moving forward when it reaches grid space 10
But why is the message not printing that the rover moves out of the grid with the step over >9?
*/

manageRover(rover, "f");
/* Result is:
Rover facing direction N, x is 0 and y is -1
The rover should not move from 0 to -1: this should not be possible and the message "not outside the grid" should be printed.
