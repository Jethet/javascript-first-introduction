-  template = preset format    literal = value written as it should be interpreted

-  Use backticks: ``

-  Text between backticks is regarded as a STRING.

-  Add a placeholder {} using the $ sign:   ${expression}

-  Use template literals also for code: console.log(`Three plus six is ${3+6}.`);

- The expression in the placeholder and the text between the backticks `` get passed
  into a function.

- The function concatenates the parts into a single string: Three plus six is 9.

- Multi-line strings can be written over separate lines, no \n or other syntax needed.
